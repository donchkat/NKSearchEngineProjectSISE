# Wikipedia Search Engine Project 2022 SISE BGU
  We are Niv and Katya, third year students in the department of Information System Engineering at BGU university.
  This is our final project in the Information Retrieval course by Nir Grinberg.
  
  Through the Semester we learned about different ways to retrieve and evaluate data.
  We went through the steps of building a search engine.
  As the final assignment - we had to build a searching engine for the whole Wikipedia.
  
# Environments we worked in:
- Google colab for small Index 
- GCP for the whole data of Wikipedia - we created a cluster in which we could build the full Inverted index for the 6000000 documents that exist in Wikipedia.
- We created a bucket where we store our index files.
